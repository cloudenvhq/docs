## Version Control

Every revision when you change your secrets is kept by default, so that you can revert if you make a mistake.

Because of the [End-to-End Encryption](/pages/features/end-to-end-encryption.html) we can't show you the differences between any two revisions, but we can show you the file size of each revision so that you get a sense for whether information was added or taken away from your secret.
